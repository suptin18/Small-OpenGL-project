# Small-OpenGL-project
This OpenGL project renders a 3D wooden chair and table with smooth edges and a black background. The table features four legs and a flat top, while the chair includes a seat, legs, and a slatted backrest. Uses GLUT for rendering and precise geometric modeling. Perfect for learning 3D object rendering in OpenGL!
