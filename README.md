# OpenGL 3D Chair and Table

This project uses **OpenGL** and **GLUT** to render a **3D wooden chair and table** with realistic proportions, smooth edges, and a black background. It serves as a great learning tool for **3D modeling, transformations, and rendering** in OpenGL.

## Features
- **3D Table** with four legs and a rectangular top.
- **3D Chair** with a seat, four legs, and a slatted backrest.
- **Precise edges** and optimized geometry.
- **Black background** for a clean visual appearance.
- Uses **GLUT** for rendering and display.

## Requirements
- OpenGL
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
- C++ Compiler (GCC, MSVC, etc.)
